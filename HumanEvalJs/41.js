 * Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.

 * are driving right to left. The two sets of cars start out being very far from
 * each other. All cars move at the same speed. Two cars are said to collide
 * when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
 * However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
 * in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
